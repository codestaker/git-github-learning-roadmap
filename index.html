                    <h3>1. Introduction to Git & GitHub</h3>
                    <p>Before we start building our portfolio, let's understand our tools.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What is Git?</strong> It‚Äôs a Version Control System (VCS). Think of it as a "save" button for your code that lets you track every change and go back in time if you make a mistake.</li>
                        <li><strong>What is GitHub?</strong> It‚Äôs a website to host your Git projects. It's like a social network for coders where you can store your code, collaborate with others, and showcase your work.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>2. Setting up Your Environment</h3>
                    <p>First, you need to install and configure Git on your computer.</p>
                    <p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Download the installer from the official <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">Git for Windows</a> website.</li>
                        <li>Run the installer and follow the setup instructions. The default options are usually fine for beginners.</li>
                        <li>Once installed, you can use the "Git Bash" application that comes with it, which provides a powerful command-line experience.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>For macOS & Linux:</strong></p>
                    <pre><code># Install on Mac (using Homebrew)
brew install git

# Install on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install git</code></pre>
                    <p>After installing, open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and check the version to confirm it's installed correctly:</p>
                    <pre><code># Check the version
git --version</code></pre>
                    <p>Now, introduce yourself to Git. This name and email will be attached to every commit you make.</p>
                    <pre><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"</code></pre>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>3. Creating Your First Project: MyPortfolio</h3>
                    <p>Let's create a folder for our project and initialize Git inside it.</p>
                    <pre><code>mkdir MyPortfolio
cd MyPortfolio
git init</code></pre>
                    <p>The <code>git init</code> command creates a hidden <code>.git</code> folder, which is the "brain" of your repository where Git stores all the version history.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>4. The Basic Workflow: Add & Commit</h3>
                    <p>Let's create a simple homepage for our portfolio and save our first snapshot.</p>
                    <pre><code>echo "<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>" > index.html
git status
git add index.html
git commit -m "Create initial homepage"</code></pre>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>git status</code>: Shows you the current state of your project (what's changed, what's new).</li>
                        <li><code>git add <file></code>: Stages a specific file, preparing it for the next commit.</li>
                        <li><code>git add .</code> : Stages all new and modified files in the current directory. This is a useful shortcut when you want to commit everything you've worked on.</li>
                        <li><code>git commit</code>: Saves a snapshot of the staged files to your project's history. The <code>-m</code> flag is for the commit message.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>5. Viewing Your Project's History</h3>
                    <p>You can see the list of commits you've made.</p>
                    <pre><code>git log
git log --oneline</code></pre>
                    <p><code>--oneline</code> gives you a much more compact view of the history.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>6. Connecting to GitHub</h3>
                    <p>It's time to put your project on GitHub!</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> and create a new repository named <strong>MyPortfolio</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Connect your local project to this new GitHub repository and push your code.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <pre><code> git branch -M main
                        git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MyPortfolio.git

git push -u origin main</code></pre>
                    <p>Now, refresh your GitHub page. You should see your <code>index.html</code> file!</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>7. Cloning a Repository</h3>
                    <p>Cloning is how you get a copy of a Git repository from a remote source like GitHub. For example, to download your portfolio project on another computer:</p>
                    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MyPortfolio.git</code></pre>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>8. Ignoring Files with <code>.gitignore</code></h3>
                    <p>Some files (like environment variables or dependency folders) shouldn't be saved in your repository. We use a <code>.gitignore</code> file to tell Git to ignore them.</p>
                    <pre><code>echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore</code></pre>
                    <p>Don't forget to commit this file!</p>
                    <pre><code>git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to exclude files"</code></pre>
                </article>

                    <h3>1. Branching: Working on New Features</h3>
                    <p>Branches are one of the most powerful features in Git. They allow you to create an independent line of development to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why create a branch?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> It provides a safe, isolated space for your work. If you make a mistake, you won't break the stable `main` branch that your team relies on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Multiple people can work on different features in parallel, each on their own branch.</li>
                        <li><strong>Organization:</strong> It keeps your commit history clean and organized. Each feature's history is contained within its own branch until it's ready to be merged.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Let's create a branch for the new contact page in our portfolio project.</p>
                    <pre><code># Create a new branch called 'feature-contact'
git branch feature-contact

# Switch to the new branch to start working on it
git checkout feature-contact</code></pre>
                    <p>Now you're on the new branch. Any commits you make here will not affect the `main` branch. Let's add a contact page.</p>
                    <pre><code>echo "<p>Contact me at my@email.com</p>" > contact.html
git add contact.html
git commit -m "Add contact page"</code></pre>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>2. Merging: Combining Your Work</h3>
                    <p>Once your feature is complete and tested on its branch, you can merge it back into your main branch to integrate it into the main project.</p>
                    <pre><code># First, switch back to the branch you want to merge INTO
git checkout main

# Now, merge the feature branch INTO main
git merge feature-contact</code></pre>
                    <p>Your `main` branch now contains all the work from the `feature-contact` branch, including the new `contact.html` file. It's now safe to delete the feature branch if you no longer need it.</p>
                    <pre><code># Delete the local feature branch
git branch -d feature-contact</code></pre>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>3. Resolving Merge Conflicts</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes, Git can't automatically merge changes if the same lines were edited on both branches. This is a <strong>merge conflict</strong>. You have to manually edit the file to resolve the conflict, then commit the fix.</p>
                    <pre><code># After manually fixing the file
git add conflicted_file.html
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"</code></pre>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>4. Working with Remotes: Push, Pull, Fetch</h3>
                    <p>To keep your local project and GitHub in sync:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>git push</code>: Sends your committed changes to the remote repository.</li>
                        <li><code>git pull</code>: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.</li>
                        <li><code>git fetch</code>: Fetches changes from the remote repository but doesn't merge them. This is useful to see what others have done before merging.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <pre><code># Push your new contact page feature branch to GitHub
git push origin feature-contact

# Update your local main branch with changes from GitHub
git pull origin main</code></pre>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Common Error: Push Rejected (Fetch First)</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes, when you try to push, you might get an error like <code>! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)</code>. This is a very common and normal situation!</p>
                    <p>It simply means that there are changes on the remote repository (on GitHub) that you don't have on your local machine yet. Git is preventing you from accidentally overwriting those changes.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> You need to pull the remote changes, merge them with your local work, and then you'll be able to push.</p>
                    <pre><code># Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch
git pull origin main

# Git will merge the remote changes into your local files.
# If there are no conflicts, you can now push your work.
git push origin main</code></pre>

                    <h3>5. Collaboration: Forks & Pull Requests (PRs)</h3>
                    <p>This is the heart of collaboration on GitHub. To contribute to someone else's project:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Fork</strong> the repository on GitHub (creates your own server-side copy).</li>
                        <li><strong>Clone</strong> your fork to your local machine.</li>
                        <li>Create a new branch for your changes.</li>
                        <li>Make your changes, commit, and <strong>push</strong> to your fork.</li>
                        <li>Open a <strong>Pull Request</strong> on GitHub to propose your changes to the original project.</li>
                    </ol>
                </article>

                    <h3>6. Undoing Mistakes</h3>
                    <p>Everyone makes mistakes. Here's how to fix them:</p>
                    <pre><code># Undo the last commit, but keep your changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# COMPLETELY undo the last commit and delete the changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert changes to a file that haven't been committed yet
git checkout -- file.html</code></pre>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>7. Tagging & Releases</h3>
                    <p>When your portfolio is ready for its first official version, you can tag it.</p>
                    <pre><code>git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0</code></pre>
                    <p>On GitHub, you can then create a "Release" from this tag, adding release notes.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>8. Stashing Changes</h3>
                    <p>Need to quickly switch branches but your work isn't ready for a commit? Use `git stash`.</p>
                    <pre><code># Temporarily save your uncommitted changes
git stash save "WIP - new navbar"

# To get your changes back
git stash pop</code></pre>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Troubleshooting Common Git Errors</h3>
                    <p>Here are some common errors you might encounter and how to solve them.</p>
                    
                    <h4>1. `fatal: not a git repository`</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You're trying to run a Git command in a folder that isn't a Git repository.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You either need to navigate to the correct folder, or initialize a new repository in the current folder with `git init`.</p>
                    <pre><code># Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/MyPortfolio

# Or initialize a new repository
git init</code></pre>

                    <h4>2. `error: Your local changes would be overwritten by merge`</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You have uncommitted local changes, and you're trying to `git pull` changes that would conflict with them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You must commit your local changes or stash them before you can pull.</p>
                    <pre><code># Option 1: Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "My local work"
git pull origin main

# Option 2: Stash your changes
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop</code></pre>

                    <h4>3. `fatal: remote origin already exists`</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You're trying to add a remote named `origin` using `git remote add`, but one with that name already exists.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You can either update the existing remote's URL or remove it and add the new one.</p>
                    <pre><code># To see your existing remotes
git remote -v

# To change the URL of the existing origin
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/NEW_USERNAME/NEW_REPO.git</code></pre>

                    <h4>4. `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories`</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> This often happens when you create a remote repository with a file (like a README) and then try to pull it into a local repository that has its own, separate commit history.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You can allow Git to merge the two different histories with a special flag. Use this with care.</p>
                    <pre><code>git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories</code></pre>

                    <h4>5. "Detached HEAD" State</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> This sounds scary, but it just means you've checked out a specific commit instead of a branch. You're no longer on a branch, so any new commits you make won't belong to any branch.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The easiest way to fix this is to check out the branch you want to be on.</p>
                    <pre><code># Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# If you made commits in the detached state and want to save them:
# Create a new branch from your current (detached) state
git branch temp-work
git checkout main
git merge temp-work</code></pre>

                    <h4>6. Overwriting Remote History with `git push --force`</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You've tried `git pull`, but you still can't push, or you've decided that your local version of the project is the correct one and you want to completely overwrite what's on the remote repository.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You can use a "force push". <strong>WARNING:</strong> This is a destructive command. It will permanently delete any history on the remote branch that you don't have locally. Only use this if you are absolutely sure you won't be overwriting someone else's work.</p>
                    <pre><code># This will overwrite the remote 'main' branch with your local 'main' branch
git push --force origin main</code></pre>

                    <p><code>git rebase</code> is an alternative to `merge`. It rewrites commit history to create a straight, linear history. It can make your project history much easier to read.</p>
                    <pre><code>git checkout feature-about
git rebase main</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Don't rebase branches that are shared with other people.</p>

                    <p>Automate your workflow. For our portfolio, you could set up a GitHub Action to automatically test your HTML for errors or deploy it to a web server every time you push to the `main` branch.</p>

                    <p>Scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow. For example, a `pre-commit` hook could run a linter on your code before you're allowed to commit.</p>
                    <pre><code># Example: A simple pre-commit hook
echo 'echo "Running pre-commit checks..."' > .git/hooks/pre-commit

                    <p>An incredibly useful tool for finding exactly which commit introduced a bug. It performs a binary search through your commit history.</p>
                    <pre><code>git bisect start
git bisect bad      # Mark the current commit as broken
git bisect good <commit-hash> # Mark a past commit as working</code></pre>

                <h2>üèóÔ∏è Sample Learning Project Flow</h2>
                <p>Here's how you can apply everything you've learned to the <strong>MyPortfolio</strong> project:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Initialize the project locally with `git init`.</li>
                    <li>Create the `index.html` homepage, commit it, and push to a new repository on GitHub.</li>
                    <li>Create feature branches for new pages: `feature-about` and `feature-contact`.</li>
                    <li>On each branch, create the new HTML file, commit it, and push the branch to GitHub.</li>
                    <li>Open Pull Requests on GitHub to merge your feature branches into `main`.</li>
                    <li>Add a `.gitignore` file to ignore files like `.env`.</li>
                    <li>Once you're happy with the site, tag a `v1.0` release.</li>
                    <li>Use GitHub Pages to deploy your portfolio to the web for free!</li>
                </ol>
